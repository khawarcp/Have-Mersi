<div data-label="Text Block"> <div class="elm text-edit"><p>So you decided to turn into a vegan because of the recognized positive impacts on the environment or your love for animals. You have made plenty of lifestyle changes, from using cruelty-free beauty products to eating plant-based meals. Your life became much greener and happier than ever. But, does your vagina go green too? Maybe not yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, let’s break the period taboo, and talk about tampons for a bit! We have found some alarming facts about the conventional tampons. You might want to check them out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>First, how much do you know about the tampons you use?</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/healthandscience/cumulative-exposure-and-feminine-care-products/">research</a>, each of 43 million women in the United States will go through an average 11,000 tampons in her lifetime. Most women use tampons to make their life much more manageable or to have a more enjoyable menstrual period experience. However, when it comes to choosing tampons, when is the last time you paid attention to the ingredients that your tampons contain? You probably don’t remember it. Since the FDA considers feminine care products as medical devices, they do not require manufacturers to disclose all of the ingredients on the products. Lack of disclosure from mainstream product brands then makes it hard for consumers to learn about what are tampons made of. Not even to say they will be aware of the toxins in the tampons they use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So, what are those conventional or non-organic tampons made of?</strong></p>
<p>Research also indicates that conventional tampons contain many harmful ingredients, such as rayon, dioxins, bleaches, pesticides, and sometimes chemical fragrances. These toxic chemicals will go directly into your body through a tampon you inserted into your vagina. As vagina is known as the most absorbent part of our body, you will quickly absorb those chemical ingredients from your tampons, increasing your exposure under potential <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355384">Toxic Shock Syndrome</a>, which is also known as TSS. TSS includes fever, rash, diarrhea, achy muscles, hormone disruption, just to name a few. Sounds scary, right?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Luckily, there are many healthier and sustainable alternatives.</strong></p>
<p><br> For instance, <a href="https://www.theveganwarehouse.com/collections/feminine-care/products/organicup-menstrual-cup"><strong>OrganiCup Menstrual Cup</strong></a> is one of the natural alternatives on the market. It is 100% chemical free as it is made of soft and allergy-friendly silicone. It minimizes the risk of TSS caused by major conventional tampons. You can wear it all-day and all-night without leak worries.  It’s also reusable and can last for years. That is, using the Menstrual Cup will be a considerable saving for you, and for our planet as well. Kind of a win-win situation, isn’t it?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you don’t like this cup option, that’s ok. We have another excellent choice for you. Try <a href="https://www.theveganwarehouse.com/collections/feminine-care/products/organic-cotton-tampon-applicator"><strong>Rael Organic Cotton Tampon</strong></a>! It is made of 100% certified organic cotton, which is super soft and gentle for your sensitive vaginal skin. It also features a soft rounded tip for comfortable insertion and expands width-wise for reliable leak protection. Similar to the Menstrual Cup we just introduced, Rael Organic Cotton Tampon does not contain any harmful chemicals like dyes, fibers, fragrances, rayon, viscose or synthetics. You can truly enjoy your menstrual period without toxins  worries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, my vegan friends, it is time to say goodbye to your non-organic tampons, and give your vagina a greener treat!</p>
