This industry has formed practices that go unseen and unheard of, rationing precious lives for aesthetics and personal gain.<b>&nbsp;While other areas such as fur and wool production have been outlawed as cruel, yet leather garments are still seen as on-trend and chic.&nbsp;</b></span><b><br></b></p><p><br></p><p>This also considerably affects the environment and even our own health. When skin is made into leather, tanneries have to process and dye the skin, using a three-part process with heavy chemicals so that it won’t rot or decompose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“Although some leather makers deceptively tout their products as “eco-friendly,” turning skin into leather also requires massive amounts of energy and dangerous chemicals, including mineral salts, formaldehyde, coal-tar derivatives, and various oils, dyes, and finishes, some of them cyanide-based,” (PETA).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The exposure of these chemicals have had harsh effects on the environment, creating toxic runoff into nearby areas, releasing harsh pollutants into the air, and taking tremendous amounts of water and land to produce. Those who work in tanneries or even live in close proximity, have faced increased exposure to develop conditions such as blindness, rashes, asthma and even cancer.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>“Arsenic, a common tannery chemical, has long been associated with lung cancer in workers who are exposed to it on a regular basis. Studies of leather-tannery workers in Sweden and Italy found cancer risks “between 20% and 50% above [those] expected.” &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p></div></div><div data-label="Heading" id="e-1591733661177" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-heading" data-ver="1" data-id="1591733661177"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-center gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs gf-elm-left-lg" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><h1><br></h1><h1>Your Choices Matter</h1></div></div><div data-label="Text Block" id="e-1569330697334" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1569330697334"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""></div></div><div data-label="Text Block" id="e-1569330697351" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1569330697351"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf-elm-left-lg gf-elm-left-md gf-elm-left-sm gf-elm-left-xs" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><p><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; letter-spacing: 0.43px; text-align: inherit;">As a whole, the pastureland needed to raise cows for leather requires trees to be cleared and cut down, ruining air circulation, excess excretion from cows to be raised on that land, and run off causing water pollution. <b>This is a trickle down effect, in which every small choice affects a much larger scale.&nbsp;</b></span><br></p><p><br></p><p>Therefore, choosing not to participate in buying leather goods has a serious impact in the continuation of the industry.
