<h2>What's your reason for being vegan? </h2>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2434/0721/files/Screen_Shot_2019-04-02_at_15.18.27_large.png?v=1554232737" alt=""></p>
<p>Is it because you want to be healthier? You love animals and choose to stand up for their rights? Maybe you just watched "What the Health"? </p>
<p>Being a vegan is all kinds of awesome no matter why you do it. But living this lifestyle fully goes beyond just your food choices.</p>
<p>Ultimately, veganism is about making a difference - for our health, for the animals, and the planet. I<em>t means caring for the welfare of every living creature, treating every earthling with the respect that they deserve. </em></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>The whole story.</h2>
<p>While most of us are aware of the consequences of our food choices, we often overlook the products that we shop for. <em>The fact is that the majority of household and personal care items available in the market either contain animal by-products or are tested on animals. </em></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>What to look out for. </h2>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2434/0721/files/IMG_4922_large.jpg?v=1553118867" alt=""></p>
<p>Just take a look at the ingredient list of your everyday hygiene products like soap or shampoo and you'll most likely find glycerin, which is derived from animal fat.</p>
<p>Other animal by-products commonly used in skincare include collagen (extracted from animal tissue and cartilage), and casein (derived from cow's milk). </p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>Even if the product you are using doesn’t directly contain animal ingredients, it has likely gone through the process of animal testing. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Be the change.  </h2>
<p>The key to making any change is education. Most of our population (even us vegans!) is largely unaware of what is inside the goods we consume.<em> By staying comfortable in our ignorance, we are unknowingly becoming part of the problem.</em></p>
<p>Change begins in the simple choices that you make everyday – choices that go well beyond your diet. </p>
<h3></h3>
<h2>The alternatives. </h2>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2434/0721/files/DSC09638-edited_1000x_2a9bbe38-562e-4906-bbc5-4c68f023762c_large.jpg?v=1550604184" alt=""></p>
<p>Nowadays, there are lots of vegan alternatives out there for literally every product imaginable. And there is no need to compromise! <em>The vegan options are just as effective and affordable as the big brand names. </em></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>The challenge is that we are often too busy to look into every product prior to purchasing and quickly fall into old habits. Reading ingredient labels and doing extensive research can be difficult and time-consuming. We hear you!</p>
